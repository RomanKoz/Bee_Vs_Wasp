Simple DL model based on Convolutional Neural Network.
For training data is used bee_vs_wasp database taken from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jerzydziewierz/bee-vs-wasp
The main purpose of project is to show basic skills in Computer Vision with applying standard Python tools for Date Science such a Pandas,
Numpy, matplotlib, sklearn and keras for Deep learning of neural network.
