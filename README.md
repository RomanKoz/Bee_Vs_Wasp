# Bee_Vs_Wasp
Simple Deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Network.
For training data is used bee_vs_wasp image database taken from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jerzydziewierz/bee-vs-wasp
The main purpose of project is to show basic skills in Computer Vision with applying standard Python tools for Date Science such as Pandas,
Numpy, matplotlib, Sklearn and Keras for CNN Deep learning.
